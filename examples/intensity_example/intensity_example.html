<h2>Calculation of intensities and peak pressure</h2>
<br>

<p>
The example here shows how to calculate intensity profiles for different
investigation situations. The spatial peak temporal average intensity is
used for scaling the impulse response of the transducer, so that the correct
intensity and pressure is obtained. A 65 elements elevation focused linear
array with a width of lambda/2 and a height of 5 mm is used in the simulation.
The center frequency and intensities are determined by the scanning situation,
which can be either for fetal or cardiac imaging. An example of an intensity
profile is shown below:

<p>The routine <i>field.m</i> initializes the field system, and should
be modified to point to the directory holding the Field II code and m-files.
The routine <i>calc_int.m</i> is then called to calculate the intensities
and pressures. The routine also calculates the pressure from a single element.
The routine can be modified for doing either cardiac or fetal imaging,
and attenuation can be included.
